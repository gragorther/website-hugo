## Other websites

- [Tsugu](https://tsugu.xyz)
A website of a guy I know online. He mostly writes about tech.
- [Iconipup](https://iconipup.neocities.org/) Someone I met online, notably she made the profile picture I use on my site.
- [Alan Pope's Blog](https://popey.com/blog/)
The blog of a prolific member of the Ubuntu community. He used to be the spokesperson for Canonical, convincing devs to publish apps on [snap](https://snapcraft.io/).
- [Landchad](https://landchad.net/)
The complete guide to self-hosting services.
- [Soatok](https://soatok.blog/)
The blog of a cybersecurity expert (it won't surprise you that he's a furry, as cybersecurity experts tend to be).
- [iOS404](https://ios404.com/)
A list of the many, many web features not implemented in Safari. An absolutely horrible browser, and the company behind it is just as bad.
- [The Cursed Computer Iceberg Meme](https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/)
An iceberg, displaying the peculiarity of software and hardware, getting more and more bizarre as we delve deeper.

## Software

### Matrix

Matrix is a decentralized chat app, also [used by Germany](https://element.io/matrix-in-germany) due to its resistance to vendor lock-in and security. Matrix has been [audited](https://element.io/blog/bsi-funds-security-analysis-of-matrix/), so you can be sure that your conversations on Matrix are secure. I use [Element](https://element.io) on the desktop and [Fluffychat](https://fluffychat.im/) on mobile, because Element on mobile is slooooooow. If you want an Element-like interface on mobile that is actually functional, I recommend [Schildichat](https://schildi.chat/), an Element fork.

### Svelte

Svelte is a really simple to use web development framework, and they recently released a pretty good update, Svelte 5 (though I might not be the best person to hold such an opinion because I'm kind of a noob at web development). The previous version of this site was actually written in Svelte, though I have now moved to Hugo.

## Videogames

### Minecraft

Regardless of the fact that Minecraft got bought by Microsoft (a horrible company, though they do take pretty good care of Minecraft) a while ago, it is still one of the best games I have ever played. I also have a [guide](/posts/minecrafthosting) for self-hosting Minecraft, because the experience is so much better if you have some people to play with. I also recommend [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) to manage multiple Minecraft instances, easily install mods and keep them updated.

### Scarlet Hollow

Scarlet Hollow is honestly the best narrative-driven game I've played. The choices you make actually matter and the story line diverges as you do so.

### Factorio

Factorio is an amazing game for nerds like me. _Everything must be optimized._ It's basically a really fancy spreadsheet, but don't worry, it's not as boring as staring at a spreadsheet all day. It is especially fun with some friends while playing on a server (I might write a guide on how to host it sometime).

### Celeste

Celeste is a really really hard game in which you play as Madeline, a girl going through some stuff (depression), and having to eventually confront herself. The story is masterfully written. I am also a huge fan of the game's art, and even though it's a 2D game it still manages to look absolutely stunning.
